# Housing-Price-Regression-Model
## Project Overview
Real estate agents know the three most important factors in determining the price of a house are
location, location, and location. But what other factors help determine the price at which a house
should be listed? Number of bathrooms? Size of the yard? 
The project aims at building a linear model to predict the selling price using a set of potential predictor variables.

## Exploring Data
The scatter plot matrix and the correlation matrix show that there exists a strong positive linear relationship between Y (selling price) and X1 (living area), and a weak positive linear relationship between Y and X2 (number of bedrooms), also Y and X3 (number of fireplaces). 
There are evidences of moderate multicollinearity. Collinearity between X1 and X2 is moderate. We can also tell that there exists weak collinearity between X2 and X3, X1 and X3.
